Retail Sales Analysis — SQL Project


This project demonstrates practical SQL Data Analysis techniques applied to a retail sales dataset.
It covers every step — from database setup, data cleaning, and exploration to answering real business questions using SQL.

It’s designed for beginners in data analytics who want hands-on experience using SQL for problem-solving and insight generation.

🎯 Objectives

Database Setup – Create and populate a retail sales database.

Data Cleaning – Detect and remove missing or invalid records.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Explore and understand data patterns.

Business Insights – Use SQL to answer real-world retail business questions.

📊 Business Questions Answered

The analysis focuses on answering key questions like:

What were the sales on a specific day?

Which product categories generated the highest revenue?

What’s the average age of customers buying specific products (e.g., Beauty)?

Who are the top 5 customers by total sales?

How do sales vary by gender and product category?

Which month performed best in each year?

How do sales differ across shifts — Morning, Afternoon, and Evening?
