Retail Sales Analysis — SQL Project


This project demonstrates practical SQL Data Analysis techniques applied to a retail sales dataset.
It covers every step — from database setup, data cleaning, and exploration to answering real business questions using SQL.

It’s designed for beginners in data analytics who want hands-on experience using SQL for problem-solving and insight generation.

🎯 Objectives

Database Setup – Create and populate a retail sales database.

Data Cleaning – Detect and remove missing or invalid records.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Explore and understand data patterns.

Business Insights – Use SQL to answer real-world retail business questions.

🗄️ Database Overview

The retail sales database stores transactional sales data, including:

Transaction details (date, time, ID)

Customer demographics (ID, gender, age)

Product details (category, quantity, price, COGS)

Calculated fields such as total sale amount


📊 Business Questions Answered

The analysis focuses on answering key questions like:

What were the sales on a specific day?

Which product categories generated the highest revenue?

What’s the average age of customers buying specific products (e.g., Beauty)?

Who are the top 5 customers by total sales?

How do sales vary by gender and product category?

Which month performed best in each year?

How do sales differ across shifts — Morning, Afternoon, and Evening?

⚙️ How to Use

Open your SQL environment ( SQL Server).

create new data base ( CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db)

Import the dataset from the [SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf .csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23023870/SQL.-.Retail.Sales.Analysis_utf.csv)
 folder into your database.

Run the SQL scripts from the /sql_scripts folder in sequence:

Business analysis queries


[SQL practice 1 github.sql](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23024015/SQL.practice.1.github.sql)

Contains SQL query outputs and analysis results.
